## Q1.3: Cross-Entropy Loss Layer

The forward pass again receives the predicted class probabilities (output from a previous activation layer)
and the ground truth labels (target). It computes the cross-entropy loss using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth labels.
The loss function measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels.

In the backward pass, you need to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the predicted probabilities. This gradient will be used to update the weights and biases of the preceding layers during backpropagation.

The equation for the cross-entropy loss is given by:
$$
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(p_i)
$$
where $y_i$ is the ground truth label, $p_i$ is the predicted probability for class $i$, and $N$ is the batch size.

Remember to handle numerical stability, it is a good practice to add a small value (e.g. $10^{-10}$) to the predicted probabilities before taking the logarithm.
